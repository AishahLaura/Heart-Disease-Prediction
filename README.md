# Heart-Disease-Prediction
This project delves into the fusion of medicine and artificial intelligence. This disease data is a typical example of supervised machine learning task. This analysis seeks to build a predictive model that answers the question "which people are more likely to have the disease compared to others?

**OBJECTIVES OF THE ANALYSIS**

 - Understanding the data: 
Superficially looking at the data to check the content and what the rows and columns look like as well as the kind of entries it contains.

 - Data cleaning and transformation:
Clean the dataset by handling missing values, duplicates, preparing it feature scaling and model building.

 - Data Preprocessing: 
Undertake feature scaling and dimensionality reduction to streamline the data, enhancing the efficiency of the prediction and model building process.

 - Data Splitting: 
Splitting the data into a train data to build the model and a test data to check if the model learnt on the data it was trained on.

- Model building and prediction: 
Building a logistic regression model, undertaking the prediction process and well as well as the K-means algorithm to further validate the model.

-	Model Evaluation: 
After the development of our model and prediction we will use accuracy score and confusion metrics to evaluate our models.

**Libraries Used For The Analysis**
- pandas for data manipulation and analysis.
- numpy for numerical operations.
- matplotlib for visualization.
- seaborn for enhanced visualizations.
- scikit-learn for preprocessing categorical data.
- from sklearn.preprocessing, we imported LabelEncoder for encodig categorical data.
- from sklearn.linear_model, we imported LogisticRegression for model building.
- from pickle, we imported TRUE to convert python objects into byte streams to store in database.
- from sklearn.preprocessing, we imported StandardScaler for feature engineering.
- from sklearn.neighbors, we imported KNeighborsClassifier for model building. This is to lay emphasis on the accuracy og the previous model built.
